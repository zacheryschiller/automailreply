automailreply
=============
*NOTE: This is still in development. Not properly working yet...

AutoMailReply helps save you time by helping you avoid answering the same question twice.

Everyday you get email. Lots of email. Sometimes these emails contain the same questions but from different people.
What if every time you got a new email some system checked to see if you had already answered an email like that and showed you the response you already write?
Well that is precisely what this project aims to do.
AutoMailReply allows you to import your old email through the standard .mbox format and add them to a database. Once this database is created, AutoMailReply can take in new messages, compare them with your old ones, and give you relevant responses based on prior interactions!
