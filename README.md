automailreply
=============
People receive and respond to emails hundreds of times a week. In some professions, such as computer technicians, these emails constantly contain the same questions and responses to and from different people. A significant amount of time is spent on repeatedly answering the same questions. Systems exist through websites or phone machines where people with questions can be guided to the answer by narrowing down their search through a set database. These systems cannot evolve and often people want the response directly from the source, the individual they are emailing. Thus an automated email replying system could help both parties.

What if every time you got a new email a system checked to see if you had already answered an email like that and showed you the response you already wrote?

Well that is precisely what this project aims to do. AutoMailReply allows you to import your old email through the standard .mbox format and add them to a database. Once this database is created, AutoMailReply can take in new messages, compare them with your old ones, and give you relevant responses based on prior interactions!

=============
To run the program:

Install scipy, numpy, and gensim on your machine by following the instructions here: http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/install.html

Then just run main.py inside the automailreply folder.

=============
AutoMailReply is using gensim found here: http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/about.html
Thanks gensim!

NOTE: This project still needs to be finished. Use at your own risk.
